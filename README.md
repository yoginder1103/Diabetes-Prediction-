# Diabetes-Prediction-
ML Project
## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.

Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy. With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.
## Types of Diabetes

•Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake). This reaction stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.

•Type 2 Diabetes

With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may not notice any symptoms, so it’s important to get your blood sugar tested if you’re at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as:

• Losing weight.

• Eating healthy food.

• Being active.

Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes.

Other types of diabetes Less common types include monogenic diabetes, which is an inherited form of diabetes, and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes ."
## Data

This data is taken from the kaggle The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

Age: Age (years)

Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Diabetes is a most common disease caused by a group of metabolic disorders. It is also known as Diabetic mellitus. It affects the organs of the human body. It can be controlled by predicting this disease earlier. If diabetics patient is untreated for a long time, it may lead to increase blood sugar. Now a days, Healthcare industries generating large volume of data. Machine Learning algorithms and statistics are used to predict the disease with the help of current and past data. Machine learning techniques helps the doctors to predict early stage for diabetics. Diabetics patient medical record and different types of algorithms are added in dataset for experimental analysis. we use logistic regression, random forest, decision tree classifier and gradient boosting to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. Performance and accuracy of the applied algorithms is discussed and compared. 

## Proposed Solution:-

• Performed more Machine learning Algorithms to get more predictability.

• Performed more Eda(Exploratory Data Analysis) visualization on Dataset.
